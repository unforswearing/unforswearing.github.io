      <br />
      <div style="padding-bottom: 20px">
        Thanks for your interest, here's a bit about me, in narrative form.
        <br /><br />
        My interest in writing began as an outlet for all of my high school-aged thoughts and feelings, but as I began to enter the workforce, I realized that written communication was something that I truly loved. Early on I tried to emulate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_Generation" target="_blank">Beat Generation</a> and 19/20th century Russian writers, eventually settling on my own style. My love for language also led me to a deep interest in linguistics, specifically sociolinguistics and how meaning is created among various (often disperate) groups in a society. Or workplace, for that matter.
        <br /><br />
        Later, while working under mentorship of a rather fantastic manager, I began to perform data analysis, write reports and instructional guides. This mostly began as a way to train my assistant manager so I could finally take a few days off of work, but we quickly realized that comprehensive training guides did not exist for most aspects of the organization. I felt lucky to help develop the process of documenting SOPs, hiring processes, and management training across the organization.
        <br /><br />
        Eventually, I began to tinker with programming and the command-line, writing tiny <code>Bash</code> scripts to create <code>ics</code> files for training events, and moved on to using <code>JavaScript</code> (via <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script" target="_blank">Google Apps Script</a>) to create more robust business workflows. And those workflows needed documentation and I was certainly up for the task.
        <br /><br />
        Alongside all of this writing experience, I also managed to teach
        myself enough Linux system administration to help migrate two different company intranets to new platforms, and develop a document schema and knowledge base for each. This systems experience coupled nicely with my ever-increasing love of programming. Oh, and I also held a PMP certification for a few years during this time as well, which has proved to be invaluable to many areas of my life, often unexpectedly.
        <br /><br />
        And finally, today I continue my love for <a href="/portfolio/profile.html?programming-automation" target="_blank">programming</a> by designing automations, markup languages, and small web applications. I will use any opportunity I can to learn a new language -- I have previously dabbled with Lua, TCL, J, F#, and I'm currently learning more about Ruby and Go. I still play music from time to time, and have collaborated with several film making friends to provide a score for their projects. And most importantly, I still write. Sincere thanks for taking the time to read.
