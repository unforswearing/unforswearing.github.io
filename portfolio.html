      <summary>*More About Me*</summary>

      Thoughtful, detail-oriented polymath - I am a talented professional and I am excited to bring my extensive knowledge to a new environment. I have over twenty years of general writing experience, crafting precise copy for web pages, mobile apps, technical documentation, and training manuals. As a writer I have developed my skill by tackling challenges head-on, managing multiple projects with tight deadlines and complex subject matter. Along the way I have grown as a writer by being flexible enough to adapt to just about any writing style and tone, prioritizing clarity, accuracy, and collaboration in every word I write. I strongly believe that communicating across a diverse range of experiences and personalities can truly help people understand and learn from each other.
