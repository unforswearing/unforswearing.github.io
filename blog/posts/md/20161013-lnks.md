# lnks

My tool to [get a list of links from Google Chrome](https://github.com/unforswearing/lnks) has been updated more than a few times since the [previous post](/blog/posts/20140802-getting-a-list-of-links-from-chrome.html), including the ability to save links to instapaper or pastebin, and an option to save the page(s) to pdf (via [wkhtmltopdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html)). Here's the brand new full list of options:

	-s to save the links to a file on the desktop
	-c to copy the links to your clipboard
	-v to print the links to stdout with leading text
	-p to print the links to stdout
	-i to save the link(s) to instapaper
	-b to save the link(s) to pastebin.com
	-w to save each url as a pdf (saves the page via 'wkhtmltopdf')
	-h prints this help message

	Note:
	- lnks accepts one option. the program will fail if run with more than one option.
	- using option -s will allow you to specify an output file, such as:
			lnks -s searchterm matchinglinks.txt

I spent a while trying to figure out what I want to do next with `lnks` and feel pretty good about what I have planned:

## Use Safari Instead  

Every now and again I take Safari out for a spin, and during one of those times I created [`surls`](https://github.com/unforswearing/surls) to mimic `lnks` functionality. Merging `surls` with `lnks` makes a lot of sense, and got me thinking maybe I can add...

## Canary, Chromium, and Webkit Support As Well  

Most (if not all) of these browsers are scriptable via `Applescript` and it's gonna be great to brush up on my Applescripting. I am more than a bit out of practice. 

## Pinboard Support  

I was [super excited](http://unforswearing.com/blog/posts/20160517-instapaper-folder-rss.html) to add Instapaper support to `lnks` but got [super bummed](http://unforswearing.com/blog/posts/20160823-instapaper-is-joining-pinterest.html) when I saw that they were sold to Pinterest. I probably won't drop Instapaper support for `lnks` (despite my silly threat), but I definitely want to add an alternative. [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) is a clean, well  developed option I have on the horizon.  

## lnks.conf  

It'd be really great to not have to specify any new or old options every time `lnks` is run, so how about a configuration file? This will essentially be an expanded version of [the current `conf` file](https://github.com/unforswearing/lnks/blob/master/.lnks.conf) that will be read at runtime. 

There are a few other maintenance updates that I have planned for the far distant future, but I'm not quite there yet. Check back soon!
