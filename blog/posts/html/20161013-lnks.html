<h1 id="lnks">lnks</h1>
<p>My tool to <a href="https://github.com/unforswearing/lnks">get a list
of links from Google Chrome</a> has been updated more than a few times
since the <a
href="/blog/posts/20140802-getting-a-list-of-links-from-chrome.html">previous
post</a>, including the ability to save links to instapaper or pastebin,
and an option to save the page(s) to pdf (via <a
href="http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html">wkhtmltopdf</a>). Here’s
the brand new full list of options:</p>
<pre><code>-s to save the links to a file on the desktop
-c to copy the links to your clipboard
-v to print the links to stdout with leading text
-p to print the links to stdout
-i to save the link(s) to instapaper
-b to save the link(s) to pastebin.com
-w to save each url as a pdf (saves the page via &#39;wkhtmltopdf&#39;)
-h prints this help message

Note:
- lnks accepts one option. the program will fail if run with more than one option.
- using option -s will allow you to specify an output file, such as:
        lnks -s searchterm matchinglinks.txt</code></pre>
<p><br> I spent a while trying to figure out what I want to do next with
<code>lnks</code> and feel pretty good about what I have planned:</p>
<h2 id="use-safari-instead">Use Safari Instead</h2>
<p>Every now and again I take Safari out for a spin, and during one of
those times I created <a
href="https://github.com/unforswearing/surls"><code>surls</code></a> to
mimic <code>lnks</code> functionality. Merging <code>surls</code> with
<code>lnks</code> makes a lot of sense, and got me thinking maybe I can
add…</p>
<h2 id="canary-chromium-and-webkit-support-as-well">Canary, Chromium,
and Webkit Support As Well</h2>
<p>Most (if not all) of these browsers are scriptable via
<code>Applescript</code> and it’s gonna be great to brush up on my
Applescripting. I am more than a bit out of practice.</p>
<h2 id="pinboard-support">Pinboard Support</h2>
<p>I was <a
href="http://unforswearing.com/blog/posts/20160517-instapaper-folder-rss.html">super
excited</a> to add Instapaper support to <code>lnks</code> but got <a
href="http://unforswearing.com/blog/posts/20160823-instapaper-is-joining-pinterest.html">super
bummed</a> when I saw that they were sold to Pinterest. I probably won’t
drop Instapaper support for <code>lnks</code> (despite my silly threat),
but I definitely want to add an alternative. <a
href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a> is a clean, well developed option
I have on the horizon.</p>
<h2 id="lnks.conf">lnks.conf</h2>
<p>It’d be really great to not have to specify any new or old options
every time <code>lnks</code> is run, so how about a configuration file?
This will essentially be an expanded version of <a
href="https://github.com/unforswearing/lnks/blob/master/.lnks.conf">the
current <code>conf</code> file</a> that will be read at runtime.</p>
<p>There are a few other maintenance updates that I have planned for the
far distant future, but I’m not quite there yet. Check back soon!</p>
