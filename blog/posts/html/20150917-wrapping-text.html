<h1 id="wrapping-text">Wrapping Text</h1>
<p>I haven’t really spent much time with <code>applescript</code>
lately. Aside from the frustrating syntax, it is my first love and (more
or less) my introduction to scripting. But alas, I have since found new
life with pure bash scripts (and some javascript) and thus my <a
href="https://github.com/unforswearing/applescript">applescripts</a>
have fallen into obsolescence. Today, however, I was reminded of how
simple applescripting can sometimes be, particularly when paired with
Automator.</p>
<p>Weeks ago, I made a quick service to wrap punctuation around selected
text, inspired by the <a
href="https://github.com/vmdanilov/TextFlow">Text Flow Automator
service</a>. This is a great tool, but is a bit slow to load.
Additionally, I found that I didn’t really use most of the options
provided. What I really needed was a quick action to wrap various types
of punctuation around selected text.</p>
<p>Thus <code>Wrap</code> was born. During it’s creation, I found that
Automator wasn’t very good at handling the Applescript
<code>error number -128</code> when called within a shell script. This
is a pretty specific use-case, I know, but I spent a few hours
attempting to deug the issue to no avail.</p>
<p>I didn’t really want to spend any time trying to recall Applescript
syntax, but I did really really want to avoid seeing an Automator error
every time I changed my mind about running the script. Eventually I
relented, dug back through some older scripts for reference, and created
an Applescript version of <code>Wrap</code>.</p>
<p>Both of these scripts can be run in or outside of automator, provided
you are able to select text prior to running the script. I would suggest
binding the script(s) to a keyboard shortcut so that they are readily at
your disposal.</p>
<p>Regardless of the script you choose, <code>Wrap</code> works as
follows:<br />
1. Type some text<br />
2. Select any text you would like to wrap<br />
3. Run <code>Wrap</code> and choose the punctuation, which is one of
<code>"</code>, <code>'</code>, <code>{}</code>, <code>[]</code>,
<code>()</code>, or “<br />
4. The selected text will be replaced with the wrapped text.</p>
<p>If you experience any issues, holler at me.</p>
