    <h1 id="wrapping-text">Wrapping Text</h1>
    <p>I haven’t really spent much time with <code>applescript</code>
      lately. Aside from the frustrating syntax, it is my first love and (more
      or less) my introduction to scripting. But alas, I have since found new
      life with pure bash scripts (and some javascript) and thus my <a
        href="https://github.com/unforswearing/applescript">applescripts</a>
      have fallen into obsolescence. Today, however, I was reminded of how
      simple applescripting can sometimes be, particularly when paired with
      Automator.</p>
    <p>Weeks ago, I made a quick service to wrap punctuation around selected
      text, inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/vmdanilov/TextFlow">Text Flow Automator
        service</a>. This is a great tool, but is a bit slow to load.
      Additionally, I found that I didn’t really use most of the options
      provided. What I really needed was a quick action to wrap various types
      of punctuation around selected text.</p>
    <p>Thus <code>Wrap</code> was born. During it’s creation, I found that
      Automator wasn’t very good at handling the Applescript
      <code>error number -128</code> when called within a shell script. This
      is a pretty specific use-case, I know, but I spent a few hours
      attempting to deug the issue to no avail.
    </p>
    <p>I didn’t really want to spend any time trying to recall Applescript
      syntax, but I did really really want to avoid seeing an Automator error
      every time I changed my mind about running the script. Eventually I
      relented, dug back through some older scripts for reference, and created
      an Applescript version of <code>Wrap</code>.</p>
    <p>Both of these scripts can be run in or outside of automator, provided
      you are able to select text prior to running the script. I would suggest
      binding the script(s) to a keyboard shortcut so that they are readily at
      your disposal.</p>
    <p>Regardless of the script you choose, <code>Wrap</code> works as
      follows:<br />
      1. Type some text<br />
      2. Select any text you would like to wrap<br />
      3. Run <code>Wrap</code> and choose the punctuation, which is one of
      <code>"</code>, <code>'</code>, <code>{}</code>, <code>[]</code>,
      <code>()</code>, or “<br />
      4. The selected text will be replaced with the wrapped text.
    </p>
    <p>If you experience any issues, holler at me.</p>
