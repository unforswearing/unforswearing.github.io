<h1 id="create-a-new-file-in-finder">Create a New File in Finder</h1>
<p>I am decidedly not a programmer, but I love recreating functionality
found in non-free applications. The latest example of this is the <a
href="https://www.producthunt.com/tech/new-file-menu">New File menu app
on Product Hunt</a>. This application essentially provides the user with
a method of creating new files on the fly, from any folder within
finder. This is a wonderful tool that can be recreated with a little
applescript. Open the Script Editor and enter the code below:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/unforswearing/eb266344d37fc9b862d305ac11633e8c.js"></script>
<p><em>Note:</em> When using this script you must enter the file name
and extension. Finder will automatically open the file in the default
application. For example, creating “My Notes.txt” will open the new file
in Text Edit (or your default application for .txt files).</p>
<p>To add the script to Finder, save as “New File” (without an
extension) and click “cmd” while dragging the script from the folder to
the Finder toolbar. You now have a quick shortcut to create a new file
any time you need one, and you saved yourself a few bucks in the
process.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the next installment, where I will recreate another
paid application.</p>
