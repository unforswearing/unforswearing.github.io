    <h1 id="hello-again-aliaser">Hello Again, Aliaser</h1>
    <br />
    <p>The joy of creating command line tools often lies in the discovery of
      personal process; knowing that there are likely hundreds of ways of
      completing a task, but designing a method that does so simply and in
      line with my own workflow/environment/brain.</p>
    <p>Creating <a href="https://github.com/unforswearing/aliaser"><strong>aliaser</strong></a>
      was perhaps the first time I felt that what I wanted matched what I was
      able to produce, but I became drowned in self doubt – why should I
      bother writing a tool when there are dozens of others that acheive the
      same goal (see <a href="https://github.com/huyng/bashmarks">bashmarks</a> et al.) – and
      deprecated my tool.</p>
    <p>But why? In my case, deprecation is a band-aid over my lack of
      experienced in a world where everyone perpetually knows more,
      understands more, and does more. A world I traipse around, taking in
      lessons and avoiding interaction. Why? I love writing little tools, and
      I love sharing sharing them as a document of who am at the time. I’m
      ripping the band-aid off to let my admittedly moderate skills breathe a
      little. I’m giving myself space to let my passions find a voice.</p>
    <p>With that, I present the ressurection of <code>aliaser</code>: a
      directory traversal tool for the bash shell, written in 116 lines of
      code. I wrote aliaser out of passion. Aliaser now lives again.</p>
