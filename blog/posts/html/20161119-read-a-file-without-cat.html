<h1 id="reading-a-file-without-cat">Reading A File Without cat</h1>
<p>I have been trying to find ways to avoid <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)#Useless_use_of_cat">useless
use of cat</a> but could never come up with a method of reading a file
that did not involve creating an entire <code>for</code> or
<code>while</code> loop. This problem crossed my mind yesterday and,
after a quick google search, I <a
href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7427262/how-to-read-a-file-into-a-variable-in-shell">found
a neat way to avoid this</a> in a single small command:</p>
<pre><code># contents of &#39;hi.txt&#39;
cat hi.txt
hi
hello
ok</code></pre>
<p>
<pre><code># reading hi.txt without &#39;cat&#39;
echo $(&lt;hi.txt)
hi hello ok</code></pre>
<p />
<p>Unfortunately, the command does not preserve new lines but for those
times when you only need to read from a single line file, this does the
trick.</p>
