    <h1 id="future-dates">Future Dates</h1>
    <br />
    I take a lot of notes in plain text and often want to add a due date
      to current tasks, but I’m usually too lazy to open up a calendar. These
      scripts (saved as applications and launched via Alfred) will quickly
      copy tomorrows date, or some date <code>x</code> days in the future.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Tomorrows Date</strong> simply copies tomorrows date to the
      clipboard.
    <pre><code>set morrow to current date  
set morrow to morrow + days  
set the clipboard to (do shell script &quot;echo &quot; &amp; morrow &amp; &quot; | sed s/,[^,]*$//&quot;)</code></pre>
    <p>If the script is run today (Thursday, March 20, 2014),
      <code>Friday, March 21</code> will be copied to the clipboard.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Future Date</strong> will fetch the date of any day in the
      future based on how many days it is from today (via dialog box).</p>
    <pre><code>set dayss to text returned of (display dialog &quot;How many days from now?&quot; default answer &quot;&quot; buttons {&quot;OK&quot;} default button &quot;OK&quot;)  
set morrow to current date  
set morrow to morrow + dayss * days  
set the clipboard to (do shell script &quot;echo &quot; &amp; morrow &amp; &quot; | sed s/,[^,]*$//&quot;)</code></pre>
    <p>If the project or task is due 4 days from today (Thursday, March 20,
      2014), enter <code>4</code> in the dialog box when your run the script.
      <code>Monday, March 24</code> will be copied to the clipboard.
    </p>
    <p>The <code>sed</code> command at the end of each script trims the date
      from <code>Thursday, March 20, 2014 12:00:00 PM</code> to a much more
      friendly <code>Thursday, March 20</code>. You can adjust the
      <code>sed</code> command to trim the text wherever you like. For
      example: if you wanted to remove everything after <code>2014</code>
      instead of after <code>March 20,</code> the <code>sed</code> script
      would read <code class="language-shell">sed s/[^2014]*$//</code>.
    </p>
    <p>Applescript allows for the adjustment of <code>hours</code> as well
      as <code>days</code>. You could alter the script to read something
      like:</p>
    <pre><code>set dued to text returned of (display dialog &quot;How many days and hours from now?&quot; default answer &quot;&quot; buttons {&quot;OK&quot;} default button &quot;OK&quot;)  
set dued to words of dued  
set dayss to item 1 of dued  
set hourss to item 2 of dued  
set morrow to current date  
set morrow to morrow + dayss * days  
set morrow to morrow + hourss * hours  
set morrow to morrow as text  
set the clipboard to morrow</code></pre>
    <p>Example: if it is currently noon on Thursday and you have a project
      due Monday at 4 pm (4 days and 4 hours from now) run the script, and
      when the dialog box appears, type <code>4</code> followed by a space and
      then <code>4</code>. The first <code>4</code> indicates the number of
      days from today, and the second <code>4</code> indicates the number of
      hours from the current time. Finally, hit enter or press
      <code>OK</code>. The script will copy
      <code>Monday, March 24, 2014 4:00:00 PM</code> to the clipboard.
    </p>
    <p>There are a few ways to edit the date and time string using
      <code>sed</code>. Replace the line
      <code>set the clipboard to morrow</code> with one of the options
      below.
    </p>
    <ul class="incremental">
      <li>If you want to remove the seconds from the time, add
        <code
          class="language-applescript">set the clipboard to (do shell script "echo " &amp; morrow &amp; " | sed s/:[^..][0-9]//2")</code>
        to the end of the script. This will give you “Monday, March 24, 2014
        4:00 PM”<br />
      </li>
      <li>And if you just wanted the hour without minutes or seconds, add
        <code>set the clipboard to (do shell script "echo " &amp; morrow &amp; " | sed s/:[^..][0-9]//g")</code>
        to the end of the script. This will give you “Monday, March 24, 2014 4
        PM”<br />
      </li>
      <li>Finally, (because I’m on a roll) if you wanted to remove the year,
        minutes and seconds, add
        <code>set the clipboard to (do shell script "echo " &amp; morrow &amp; " | sed s/:[^..][0-9]//g | sed s/20..// | sed s/' '//3")</code>
        to the end of the script. This will give you “Monday, March 24, 4
        PM”
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am not familiar enough with <code>sed</code>/<code>regex</code> to
      write a more elegant solution for the last scenario, but it works well
      enough so I’m satisfied.</p>
    <p>I created an applet called <strong>Dued</strong> that has all the
      functionality of the above script, with a few added options for date and
      time processing. Repository home is <a href="https://github.com/unforswearing/dued">located here</a>. Updates
      soon.</p>
