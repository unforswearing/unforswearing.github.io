<h1 id="future-dates">Future Dates</h1>
<p>I take a lot of notes in plain text and often want to add a due date
to current tasks, but I’m usually too lazy to open up a calendar. These
scripts (saved as applications and launched via Alfred) will quickly
copy tomorrows date, or some date <code>x</code> days in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Tomorrows Date</strong> simply copies tomorrows date to the
clipboard.</p>
<pre class="applescript"><code>set morrow to current date  
set morrow to morrow + days  
set the clipboard to (do shell script &quot;echo &quot; &amp; morrow &amp; &quot; | sed s/,[^,]*$//&quot;)   </code></pre>
<p>If the script is run today (Thursday, March 20, 2014),
<code>Friday, March 21</code> will be copied to the clipboard.</p>
<p><strong>Future Date</strong> will fetch the date of any day in the
future based on how many days it is from today (via dialog box).</p>
<pre class="applescript"><code>set dayss to text returned of (display dialog &quot;How many days from now?&quot; default answer &quot;&quot; buttons {&quot;OK&quot;} default button &quot;OK&quot;)  
set morrow to current date  
set morrow to morrow + dayss * days  
set the clipboard to (do shell script &quot;echo &quot; &amp; morrow &amp; &quot; | sed s/,[^,]*$//&quot;)    </code></pre>
<p>If the project or task is due 4 days from today (Thursday, March 20,
2014), enter <code>4</code> in the dialog box when your run the script.
<code>Monday, March 24</code> will be copied to the clipboard.</p>
<p>The <code>sed</code> command at the end of each script trims the date
from <code>Thursday, March 20, 2014 12:00:00 PM</code> to a much more
friendly <code>Thursday, March 20</code>. You can adjust the
<code>sed</code> command to trim the text wherever you like. For
example: if you wanted to remove everything after <code>2014</code>
instead of after <code>March 20,</code> the <code>sed</code> script
would read <code>sed s/[^2014]*$//</code>.</p>
<p>Applescript allows for the adjustment of <code>hours</code> as well
as <code>days</code>. You could alter the script to read something
like:</p>
<pre class="applescript"><code>set dued to text returned of (display dialog &quot;How many days and hours from now?&quot; default answer &quot;&quot; buttons {&quot;OK&quot;} default button &quot;OK&quot;)  
set dued to words of dued  
set dayss to item 1 of dued  
set hourss to item 2 of dued  
set morrow to current date  
set morrow to morrow + dayss * days  
set morrow to morrow + hourss * hours  
set morrow to morrow as text  
set the clipboard to morrow  </code></pre>
<p>Example: if it is currently noon on Thursday and you have a project
due Monday at 4 pm (4 days and 4 hours from now) run the script, and
when the dialog box appears, type <code>4</code> followed by a space and
then <code>4</code>. The first <code>4</code> indicates the number of
days from today, and the second <code>4</code> indicates the number of
hours from the current time. Finally, hit enter or press
<code>OK</code>. The script will copy
<code>Monday, March 24, 2014 4:00:00 PM</code> to the clipboard.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to edit the date and time string using
<code>sed</code>. Replace the line
<code>set the clipboard to morrow</code> with one of the options
below.</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>If you want to remove the seconds from the time, add
<code>set the clipboard to (do shell script "echo " &amp; morrow &amp; " | sed s/:[^..][0-9]//2")</code>
to the end of the script. This will give you “Monday, March 24, 2014
4:00 PM”<br />
</li>
<li>And if you just wanted the hour without minutes or seconds, add
<code>set the clipboard to (do shell script "echo " &amp; morrow &amp; " | sed s/:[^..][0-9]//g")</code>
to the end of the script. This will give you “Monday, March 24, 2014 4
PM”<br />
</li>
<li>Finally, (because I’m on a roll) if you wanted to remove the year,
minutes and seconds, add
<code>set the clipboard to (do shell script "echo " &amp; morrow &amp; " | sed s/:[^..][0-9]//g | sed s/20..// | sed s/' '//3")</code>
to the end of the script. This will give you “Monday, March 24, 4
PM”</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not familiar enough with <code>sed</code>/<code>regex</code> to
write a more elegant solution for the last scenario, but it works well
enough so I’m satisfied.</p>
<p>I created an applet called <strong>Dued</strong> that has all the
functionality of the above script, with a few added options for date and
time processing. Repository home is <a

soon.</p>
