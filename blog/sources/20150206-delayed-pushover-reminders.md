I began using [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) late last year and immediately loved it for its ability to send messages [via their api](https://pushover.net/api) and shell script. While I obviously love scripting, I mostly enjoyed this feature because it would allow me to set delayed reminders for things that I always forget (going to the post office, brinigng something to work, logging work hours, etc). While I typically use the [my slightly altered version](https://github.com/unforswearing/nvremind) of [Brett Terpstraâ€™s nvremind script](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvremind/) on my work computer, this pushover script works well when I am on my home laptop and need to think of something quickly. Take a look below and let me know if you find a use for it.
