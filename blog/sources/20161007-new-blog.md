# New Blog

Got tired of using wordpress so I made my own thing. Inspired by [Brendan Gregg's blog](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/index.html) and [Bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog).

More tweaks coming, and you will certainly find broken things. Appearance should continue to improve over the next few months.
