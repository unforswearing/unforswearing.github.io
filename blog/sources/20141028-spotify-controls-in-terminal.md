There are many [spotify control scripts that can be run from the command line](https://www.google.com/webhp?gws_rd=ssl#safe=off&q=spotify+control+terminal), however, I have had a difficult time getting them to work on my system. My solution to this was to create a stupidly simple script to stop, start, and list track info for Spotify. This works perfectly for me, as I only need to pause or restart a track (and usually listen to entire albums or play lists). If Spotify ever adds applescript support for natural language searches (instead of the Spotify url scheme), Iâ€™ll happily update this script. For now, take a look below.
