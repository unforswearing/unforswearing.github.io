In 2010, much of my in-browser time was spent searching for and managing bookmarks in Chrome. After a brief time with [Pocket/Read It Later](https://getpocket.com/), I was delighted to discover [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com) and almost immediately became a subscriber. Since then, I have combined my love for Instapaper with my interest in coding, writing a [couple](/2016/05/17/instapaper-folder-rss/) [tools](http://github.com/unforswearing/lnks) that integrate with the service. These tools aren't widely adopted as far as I can tell, and I may, in fact, be the only person using them. However, the sale of Instapaper to Pinterest is pretty disappointing. To quote [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12345283) user **AlexandrB:**    
  
> The post says that, at least for the time being, nothing is going to change for their users. Except a new third party (Pinterest) will sooner or later have access to my Instapaper data. I trusted Instapaper because they had a sustainable business model not based around ads. I do not trust Pinterest because their business model is based around selling my personal information and activity to advertisers. Basically it's time to stop using Instapaper :(  
  
In the coming months, I anticipate creating versions of my aforementioned tools that can be used with [Pinboard.in](http://pinboard.in) (and possibly Pocket). The Instapaper tools will remain as they are, with no further development. Again, this may only matter to me, but it definitely matters a lot.
