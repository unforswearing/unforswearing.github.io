I have been working on several [Alfred workflows](https://github.com/unforswearing/alfredWorkflows) that I use on a regular basis, and I wanted to share two of my favorites here.  
  
The **Markdown Links Worklow** allows you to easily copy formatted mardown links to your clipboard for easy pasting. There are three types of links this workflow can handle:  
  
  1. Keyword `mdlink` will copy a standard markdown link to your clipboard.   
  2. Keyword `mdimage` will copy a mardkown formatted image to your clipboard.   
  3. Keyword `mdclick` will copy a click-through image link to your clipboard.

Another workflow I use on a daily basis is the **Clipboard Text Processing** tool. There are currently 10 different options available in this workflow:  
  
  1. Add a custom delimiter between words in a string (keyword `tpd`)   
  2. Add parenthesis to a string (keyword `tpp`)   
  3. Add quotes to a string (keyword `tpq`)   
  4. Alphabetize a list (keyword `tpa`)   
  5. Convert a string to Title Case (keyword `tpt`)   
  6. Convert a string to Title Case with no spaces (keyword `tpts`)   
  7. Convert to all lower case (keyword `tpl`)   
  8. Convert to all upper case (keyword `tpu`)   
  9. Create a slug (keyword `tps`)   
  10. Remove spaces from a strong (keyword `tprs`)

A description of the `applescript` and `bash` commands used for these processes [can be found here](https://github.com/unforswearing/alfredWorkflows/blob/master/help/ClipboardTextProcessing.md).
