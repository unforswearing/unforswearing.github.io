  
# Finder Services  
  
Along the same lines as the previous post, I have been working on a new [Alfred workflow](https://github.com/unforswearing/alfred-workflows) that handles various Finder actions.  
  
When setting up a new computer, I usually add several Applescript apps to the Finder toolbar that allow me to quickly do things like hide application widows, close Finder windows, resize Finder, copy the path of an application, etc. The Finder Services script/Alfred workflow takes care of these things (and more) without having to clutter up my toolbar. This has also saved me a tremendous amount mouse movements and clicks, all in my quest to use the mouse as infrequently as possible.  
  
The workflow itself will be posted to my Github page sometime this weekend (with full documentation, for now the commented lines indicate what is being done). Feel free to alter the script below as you see fit, and let me know if you come up with something better/different/killer.
