I had been a Google Chrome user, but after a crappy [Chrome bug that auto played all youtube videos](https://gigaom.com/2014/08/19/google-cast-chrome-extension-bug-turns-on-auto-play-for-youtube-videos/) and a troublesome upgrade to Yosemite, I figured I would see how far the stock OS X applications would get me before I became completely annoyed.  
  
With Chrome (and a little [chrome-cli](https://github.com/prasmussen/chrome-cli) magic) I had [lnks](http://unforswearing.tumblr.com/post/93620256762/getting-a-list-of-links-from-chrome) to search tabs for specific urls. I knew that Safari had good applescript support (somewhat obviously, being a native application (looking at you, Logic â€“ just let me automate bouncing!)), so I created a command line tool with the same functionality for Safari. Grab it below.
