As mentioned in [a previous post](/blog/posts/20160517-instapaper-folder-rss.html), managed to find a way to share articles saved in various Instapaper folders by grabbing the RSS feed. The result is [instapaper rss](http://github.com/unforswearing/instapaper-rss), which is updated several times per day via bash script. I had fun making this and hopefully it will be of interest you.  

update: [the tools used to generate the page have been added to github](https://github.com/unforswearing/instapaper-rss)
