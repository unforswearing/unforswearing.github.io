I have been doing a lot with bash lately, including staying up all night to write a bash alarm. It started when I needed to set a timer and didn’t feeling using my phone/didn’t have a timer/alarm application on my computer that I wanted to use. The end result is `nigh`: a bash timer.  
  
From the [nigh repository](http://github.com/unforswearing/nigh):  
      
      
    USAGE:   
      nigh [time option] [time] [alarm option]  
      
    TIME OPTIONS:  
      -h [hours]               -- enter time in hours  
      -m [minutes]             -- enter time in minutes  
      -hm [hours and minutes]  -- enter time in hours and minutes, eg '1:45'   
      -s [seconds]             -- enter the time in seconds  
      
    ALARM OPTIONS:  
      -a   -- cycle through 12 times and display notification    
      -f   -- flash the screen instead of using audio alerts    
      -l   -- cycle through 12 times instead of 6    
      -n   -- display a notification in notification center    
      -q   -- suppress 'TIME IS UP' message (audio only)    
      -x   -- perform options -f -l and -n      
      
      running nigh without an alarm option (as in 'nigh -m 30') will alert via the default alarm.   
      
    EXAMPLE:  
      'nigh -m 10'    -- set an alarm for ten minutes from now  
      'nigh -s 45'    -- set an alarm for 45 seconds from now  
      'nigh -h 2 -f   -- set an alarm for 2 hours from now and flash the screen (no audio)  
      'nigh -hm 1:20' -- set an alarm for 1 hour and 20 minutes from now  
      
    Enter 'nigh help' to display this help text    
      
  
[You can find the script here if you want to take it for a little test drive](https://github.com/unforswearing/nigh/blob/master/nigh.sh). Let me know if its useful for you.
