<br>

## I need project management!  
  
I spent a large portion of the evening attempting to find an easy to use personal project management application. Specifically, I wanted something self-hosted, as I tend to be a bit paranoid with new(-ish) webapps that may eventually be abandoned or dismantled or purchased by a larger company who will then abandon it or dismantle it (looking at you, google).

## The Search  
  
Truth be told, I found a lot. [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) looks great, but I have an unreasonable dislike of Java. Plus, it is a [heavy install](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/jira-requirements-185729596.html), which didn't work so well on my minimal server. [osTicket](http://osticket.com/) was also ok, but I couldn't get past the sort of clunky, 2005 interface. The installation also wasn't nearly as simple as I was lead to believe. After finally managing to get it started, I decided that maybe I did not need anything more than a simple issue tracking system. I began to look into Github issue integrations, since I already use [Github](http://github.com/unforswearing) and it wouldn't be very difficult to maintain a minimal task management system via [Github Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). I found [several blog posts about the benefits of using Github for project management](https://www.google.com/search?q=github+issues+management&oq=github+issu&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i60l2j69i64.2246j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8), but could not find an application that did what I wanted for free (for a number of reasons, it takes me a very long time to evaluate software, often much longer than any free trial could offer. Please don't let my limitations stop you from exploring [these options](https://github.com/integrations) if you're looking for something similar). I remembered that [Gitlab](http://gitlab.com) offered free private repositories, and I could use those to essentially develop my own minimal project management system: upload minimal code to the repository, but heavily use the issues feature to track tasks and updates. I started using (and still use) Gitlab to store my own private configuration backups, but because I wasn't yet used to the user interface, the issue tracking feature took a bit of effort to understand and implement.

## Gogs  
  
Eventually, I remembered [Gogs](https://gogs.io/), a new Github-style self-hosted git service. Of everything I tried to install myself, Gogs was by far (by miles) the easiest to add to my tiny server and get running. Gogs offers many of the basic features of Github, but in a much lighter package. I could never pay for something like Github Enterprise, and do not want to spend any more cash on my little server just so it can run an issue tracker. Gogs fits very nicely into the personal/power user category that I seem to find myself in -- I am by no means a developer, but I love scripting. The simplicity of Gogs plays very well to my needs and abilities. Take a look for yourself, if you're interested in hosting your own code/issues/etc. Please keep in mind that I do not know the developers of Gogs, I just really love the project and want to spread the word.
