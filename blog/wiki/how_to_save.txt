But be careful because it seems very easy to lose data. At least in my testing, if you create a new page but don't save and close the tab then you lose all data without any warnings. Similarly, if you are in the middle of adding content to a page and close the tab then it is gone without any confirmation box. A built-in browser confirmation box when closing tab/window should be relatively easy to add in I think.
