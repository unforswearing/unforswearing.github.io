### Pre-Inventory Preparation

Preparing for Produce Inventory involves several steps:  

- Update the **Inventory Count Sheet** with new items sold during the period from the **Item Net Optimized by Store** report in the Catapult point-of-sale database.  
- Find items that were sold from the **Produce Disco** department by running the **Item Net Optimized by Store** report in catapult, using **Produce Disco** as the department instead of **Produce**.
- Correct any issues that resulted in sales from the **Produce Disco** department.
- Check for new issues and update current issues with PLU, UPC, or Item IDs.
- Email the **Produce Inventory Files for Produce Staff** file to the Produce Buyer by 5pm on the Friday before Inventory.
- Add any new items into Catapult before 9 PM on Saturday evening to make sure they are updated by Inventory on Sunday.    

These steps should not occupy more than a few hours combined time before Inventory, excluding updating PLU, UPC, Item IDâ€™s, which should be done as issues arise throughout the Period (via the Forms). 

*Updating the Inventory Count Sheet*

Updating the **Inventory Count Sheet** is the most important part of preparing for produce inventory. This sheet will reset the current item totals with the newly counted totals, a process that cannot be undone. Updating the sheet involves running the **Item Net Optimized** report for all stores in Catapult and adding new items to the "PX INV 2" count sheet file. 

**Step 1 - Running the Item Net Optimized report**

To run the Item Net Optimized report in Catapult:  

- In the main landing page click "Reports" located at the top of the screen.
- Next, select "POS Optimized" and then "Inventory Transaction".  
- Finally, scroll down until you find the "Item Net Optimized" report.  
- Click "Display" to run the report
- A new screen will appear that will allow you to update reporting options
  - In the "Date-Time Range" box, be sure that the start date is the first day of the period and the end date is the current day.  
  - In the "Store" box, be sure that all stores are selected. 
- Click "Apply Filter" to apply the changes. 
- In the next screen find the "Department" section. 
  - Make sure "Produce" is the only department selected
- Click "Apply Filter" to apple these changes
- When the "Enter Parameter Values" window appears, you will see two sorting options for the report:
	- **Numeric Field Sort** at the top of the window
	- **Text Field Sort** below
  - In the **Numeric Field Sort** section, click the drop-down menu and select "NONE"
- In the **Text Field Sort** section, be sure "Receipt Alias" is selected. This option should already be selected when the window appears. 
- Click "OK" at the bottom of the screen to run the report.

The report that appears will show each individual item sold by all departments in a single list. This report should be sorted alphabetically, and items from this list will be added to the PX INV 2 count sheet file sent out to each store. 

Since the PX INV 2 count sheet file is transferred from period to period, there is no need to recreate this file for each inventory. However, new items from the Item Net Optimized report need to be added at the end of each period to reflect seasonal items that have become available. 

**Step 2 - Updating the PX INV 2 count sheet file**

A few notes about updating the file

- Not all new items need to be added. For Example: you might not want to add PLUs/UPCs that are alternate ID's or items that are obvious misrings.
- At this time, items are only added and not removed. This means that, after a certain period of time very few new items will need to be added to this file from period to period. 
- Most items added are items that have come into season during the period or UPCs for new products that have recently become available.

Updating the PX INV 2 count sheet file involves comparing the Item Net Optimized report and the previous period PX INV 2 file.  For example, if you were creating the PX INV 2 file for Period 1, you will use the P13 INV 2 file to compare with the Item Net Optimized report for the start and end dates of P1.

*Searching for Items Sold from the **Produce Disco **department*

There are some instances of discontinued items being sold from the **Produce Disco **department, which indicates:

- an item has not been properly discontinued
- an alternate ID has not been properly reassigned to the correct item in the PRODUCE department in catapult

Prior to each inventory, it is important to run an Item Net Optimized report for the **Produce Disco **department to ensure that all items have been properly discontinued and/or any alternate IDs have been reassigned to items in the PRODUCE department.  

To run this report

- In Catapult, select "Reports" at the top of the screen  
- Next, select "POS Optimized" and then "Inventory Transaction"  
- Finally, scroll down until you find the "Item Net Optimized" report.  
- Click "Display" to run the report
- In the "Date-Time Range" box, be sure that the start date is the first day of the period and the end date is the current day.  
- In the "Store" box, be sure that all stores are selected. 
- Click "Apply Filter"  
- In the next screen, be sure that "Produce Disco" is the only department selected, and then click "Apply Filter"
- When the "Enter Parameter Values" window appears, you will see two sorting options for the report:
	- **Numeric Field Sort** at the top of the window
	- **Text Field Sort** below the **Numeric Field Sort**
- In the **Numeric Field Sort** section, click the drop-down menu and select "NONE"
- In the **Text Field Sort** section, be sure "Receipt Alias" is selected. 
  - This option should already be selected when the window appears. 
- Click "OK" at the bottom of the screen to run the report.

The report should contain very few items since this report is being run for the **Produce Disco** department.

*Correcting issues that cause sales from the  Produce Disco department*

Any items that are in the **Item Net Optimized** report for **Produce Disco** should be sent to the Produce Buyer for correction.

*Update item coding issues and Add new items into Catapult*

PLU / UPC / Item ID issues are most often caught in the store and it is the responsibility of the produce managers to report these issues to to the Produce Buyer by submitting the **Coding Issues** form. Catapult takes up to 24 hours to process changes so it is important that all issues are submitted through the forms no later than 5 PM on Saturday evening prior to inventory. Any issues that are reported after this deadline will make it into Catapult but may not be updated in time to receive invoices or credit memos committed the day of inventory. Please adhere to this deadline to avoid creating more work for the Accounting department or produce managers.

The same deadline applies to new items that the produce departments may have received during the previous four week period. It is especially important for produce managers to avoid selling new products using incorrect PLUs. Using incorrect PLUs result in inaccurate inventory totals, additional work for the Produce Buyer and Accounting Department, and failure to pay vendors on time.

*Sending out the Produce Inventory files to Produce Staff by 5pm on the Friday before Inventory*

The Produce Inventory files are tools that each produce manager needs in order to keep on track during inventory. The files include:

- **instruction_counting_inventory.pdf**
	- Text instructions for conducting produce inventory in the stores

- **checklist_catapult_inventory.pdf**
	- A checklist that supplements the text instructions
  
- **PRO_PX_INV_2.txt**
	- The count sheet that is uploaded to each stores Catapult 

The Produce Inventory files also contains a list of notes and reminders for the produce staff. All produce managers should review this list every inventory as it contains information about handling inventory in the following circumstances:

- Stores are closing early
- Changes in the inventory process that need to be communicated 
- Repeat issues from multiple departments that need to be addressed
