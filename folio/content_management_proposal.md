# Proposal for Content Management

The goal of the system described in this proposal is to provide structure to the
catalog of training documentation that is available to employees across the
company. This structure will be based on a content management schedule that
reduces confusion around document versions and accuracy. This should include:

1.  *Style guide for written and online materials*
    - Such as font attributes, colors, call-out boxes, tables, and others.

2.   *Regular revision of currently available documentation*
     - Such as manuals, one-pagers, video scripts, or any other written training
         document.
     - A copy editor will work with the department point-person to ensure that
         the content retains its original intent through the editing process.
     - The material is still owned by the respective department and they will
         have the right to veto any content changes made by the Training Team.
3.   *Submit video proposals*
     - Use a form to submit various video information, such as overview,
        location, actors, script, props/resources, location, etc).
4.   *Create training modules*
     - Standardize training module format to simplify the process of creating
        new modules.
     - Employees will submit a form to provide details such as module content
        (text, images, links, and other resources) and, quiz information (number
        of questions, the questions, and their answers, scoring system, and
        others)
5.   *Update all training materials regularly.*
     - Department heads/point-persons will regularly review the current training
        materials and make updates as needed.
6.   *Update Schedule* 
     - The Training Team will apply all changes for the departments on a
         rotating basis. For example: If the Produce department submits their
         materials in April, the Training Team will have the revisions complete
         by the same day in May. This allows one full month to review, revise,
         and implement changes.
     - The rotating update schedule provides structure to the creation and
         maintenance of documentation created by each department. This schedule
         also allows the Training Department to systematically work through the
         materials and make changes on a regular and expected schedule.
     - Each department will update its materials in the period before the
         scheduled review by the Training Team.
     - Updates will be submitted to the Training Department on a regular
         schedule, to be determined by the external department. Up to twice per
         year except when position descriptions change, departments are
         restructured, etc.

The individual departments should only be responsible for the creation of
content, for example, writing manuals, one-pagers, and video scripts, sourcing
video materials, actors, locations, and props, and others. The Training
Department will create a short best practices guide for each available document
type (written, video, module) to ensure the training materials from each department can be integrated into the company-wide content management system.

Before any revisions can begin the Training Team will meet with department heads
to discuss their current training systems and content. This includes:

- What training materials already exist (video, manuals, one-pagers, etc).
- What current materials can be improved or extended into other formats (videos,
    manuals, one-pagers).
- What topics are not yet covered via training materials.
- How can the Training Team help other departments develop training content.

A similar meeting should occur no less than twice per year. This will help
establish regular benchmarks for each department\'s progress towards creating or
updating training documentation.

The Content Update Calendar will act as a resource for departments and the
Training Team to show: When each department will submit updates, When the
Training Department will complete updates, When the Training Department and
departmental heads/point-persons will meet to discuss their progress.

## Summary

With this content management structure, we can plan for a more robust and
durable program for developing department-specific training materials. Managers
can focus on their department-specific training needs without the uncertainty of
out-of-date documentation. Managers are fully in charge of the integration of
the training materials into their department.
