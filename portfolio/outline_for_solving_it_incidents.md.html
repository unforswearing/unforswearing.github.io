<h3><a id="the-internet-is-down">The Internet Is Down</a></h3>
<BR>
If the internet is down in your store, first check to see if the switches and firewall are powered up.
<p>If the switches are powered up, reboot the firewall by unplugging it and plugging it back in. If internet service has returned after rebooting the firewall, you are done.
<BR></p>
<p><strong>Rebooting the firewall did not solve my issue</strong></p>
<p>If the internet is still down after rebooting the firewall:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the power cords to the switches and firewall are plugged into a working power source.</li>
<li>Be sure to check that the plugs on both the back of the machine and the wall outlet are firmly in place
a. eg. Plugs are not partially plugged in, or obstructed in any way</li>
<li>If plugging the firewall and/or switches into a working power source resolved the issue, you are done.
<BR></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The firewall and switches are both plugged into a working power source, but the internet is still down</strong></p>
<p>If the firewall and switches are plugged into a working power source but you are still having issues with the internet, restart the internet Service Providers equipment. To do this two pieces of equipment need to be restarted:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Windstream device and</li>
<li>Most stores have a Comcast modem
a. Waldorf uses Megapath
b. Herndon and Merrifield use Cox</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are unsure where the device is located, you can follow the cables from the firewall to the modem or Windstream device.</p>
<p>If restarting the Internet Service Providers equipment resolved the issue, you are done. If the internet is still not working after following the above steps, please <a href="#contacting-support">contact support</a>.

<h3><a id="phones-not-working">Phones not working</a></h3>
<BR>
If a phone in your store is not working, first determine how many phones are affected by this issue by testing each phone individually.
  <BR>
<p><strong>Only one phone is affected by this issue</strong></p>
<p>If you find that the issue has only affected one phone, then reboot the non-working phone:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unplug the power supply for the phone and plug it back in.</li>
<li>Wait five minutes and then test the phone.</li>
<li>Make note of any warnings or errors that appear on the display of the phone.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your phone works after rebooting, you have resolved the issue.
<BR></p>
<p><strong>Rebooting the phone did not fix my problem</strong></p>
<p>If the phone is not working, write down any warnings or messages that appeared on the display of the phone and <a href="#contacting-support">contact support</a> with this information.
<BR></p>
<p><strong>More than one phone/all phones in the store are having the same issue</strong></p>
<p>If all phones in the store are not working then you will need to reboot the phone server.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the LAN closet, find the black server labeled &quot;Phone Server&quot;</li>
<li>Unplug both of the power cords running into the back of the server, wait a moment, and then plug them back in.</li>
<li>After plugging the power cords back in, wait five minutes and then test the phones.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your phones are working, you may begin calling people.
<BR></p>
<p><strong>Rebooting the phone server did not fix this problem</strong></p>
<p>If the phones are still not working, please <a href="#contacting-support">contact support</a>.

<p><strong>Paging system and music are not working</strong></p>
<p>If both the paging system and music are not functioning properly, you may need to restart the amplifier.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the LAN closet, locate the amplifier (the amplifier may be located in a different area of your store. Please check with IT or a store manager to determine its location).</li>
<li>Locate the power switch on the amplifier. If the amplifier is powered off, power it back on and test the paging system and music.</li>
