  <p class="info">Consciousness<br />Jan 23, 2025 02:23 PM</p>
  <p><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Let me begin by saying that I am not looking for an argument. I just want to provide some insight / guidance that could assist you, as it did me.</p> <p>I am not a materialist and for those who are, or for those who are not but are looking for additional understanding, I just want to suggest that you keep a very open mind when studying consciousness. Several years ago, when I was very much struggling to understand consciousness, the nature of the universe, religious beliefs, etc., I searched far and wide for something that would give me a solid answer. But, as we know, there are countless theories out there, some of which may be viewed as better or more thorough than others. </p> <p>For the materialist: I want you to consider that it may never be possible (and, in my view, is never possible) to fully objectively explain something that is inherently subjective, such as human consciousness, qualia, etc. It might ultimately be the case that the reason there is consciousness is not that it somehow emerged from &quot;dead&quot; matter, but that the matter is within or a product of consciousness and our inability to understand it derives from us being within a wider consciousness.</p> <p>For those who are not materialists, or for those who are willing to explore new ideas: I have found great comfort in the work of Bernardo Kastrup and the Essentia Foundation. While I don't agree with everything Kastrup has to say, I think he is greatly onto something. I have ultimately come to the conclusion -- and along with it has come an innate feeling -- that consciousness is fundamental and it is the material universe that emerged out of it, not the other way around. Beyond the work of Kastrup and the Essentia Foundation, I think it has been extremely important to study near-death experiences, psychedelic experiences, meditative states, as well as various religious beliefs -- most of which go back thousands of years and have a rich history. While doing so, it has been important to avoid confirmation bias. A study of all the above, however, reveals trends that are impossible to ignore. And again, I started with a blank slate when I began looking into this many years ago. </p> <p>I believe that studying all of the above can provide a huge amount of insight into our lives, the nature of the universe, and the afterlife (which I personally think is itself quite complex, beyond our understanding, though I think religions, NDEs, etc., provide us with some guidance on what to expect, including the degree to which we do, or can, keep our sense of self.) </p> <p>Also, take some time to look within yourself. Consider what it is that you are feeling right now, what you are seeing, hearing, what you taste -- your subjective experiences, which truly is your entire life. The complexity of that alone -- of daily life -- and the inability to objectively explain it could open you up to more ideas. I believe that if more people realize this, together we can develop a better understanding of consciousness, religion, metaphysics, the meaning and value of life, the magnitude of experience, and so on. In turn, we can have a better world, individual lives, and look forward to what comes after this one.</p> <p>Overall, I have found that being open to new ideas, looking at the &quot;whole picture,&quot; and recognizing flaws or insurmountable road blocks, has greatly helped me. I hope it can for you too.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Curious078"> /u/Curious078 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/1i8bk9j/something_to_consider/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/1i8bk9j/something_to_consider/">[comments]</a></span></p>

  <p><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Question: Are you interested in dream phenomenology? </p> <p>There's a strong overlap in cortical activity which is associated with perception and visual imagery. This one has been used to show that <em>1)</em> classifying dreams as either hallucinatory or imaginative is complicated, and <em>2)</em> even a strong overlap between visual perception and visual dream imagery, doesn't <em>necessarily</em> make a distinction between dreaming and waking imagination. </p> <p>Now, somebody might pull out heavy artillery, possibly a red herring, and say that it also doesn't set waking life apart from dreaming or &quot;waking&quot; imagination in some other world beyond dreams, and hence beyond waking life, for a dream could fool us. </p> <p>If we take this suggestion seriously, we may confess that it seems implausible that life is just a dream, but it also seems implausible in dreams that dream is just a dream. There are dreams even in dreams, so there's a distinction between &quot;real&quot; and &quot;dream&quot; even in dreams. When you get immersed in strange dreams, they often don't seem strange at all, even when the experience is other-wordly or cartoonish, and we would expect no less when dreams are hyper-real. People typically cite brain activity or relevant brain regions, that settle the case about why we do not recognize obvious fantastical monstruoisty of dreams, but behave as if it's normal that we are seeing a giant spider that speaks english and wears Real Madrid dress while chasing us with a knife, trying to stab us, and we have wheels instead of legs, so bye bye spider!</p> <p>People cite lucid dreams in order to show that you can practically realize in dreams that dream is just a dream, thus become lucid and take partial control over its contents in such a way that it would seem impossible to happen in waking life. For example, you can just fly away, or move the mountain with your thoughts. </p> <p>There's a scientific evidence that lucid dreams occur. As far as I remember it was La Berge's team that showed it in late 20st century, namely that lucid dreamers can use particular or specific, pre-arranged patterns of eye movement in order to signal in real-time that dreamers are lucid and engaged in this dream experiment. Notice that before La Berge's demonstration, virtually all scientists, with negligible exceptions, claimed that lucid dreams are impossible! </p> <p>These signals, besides being identifiable on the EOG(right and left eye electrooculogram), suggest a correspondence between real and dream eye movements, predicted by Dement and Kleitman 1957. Their research hypothesis was this:</p> <p><em>1)</em> There'll be a significant association betweem REM sleep and dreaming.</p> <p><em>2)</em> There will be a positive correlatoon between estimated dream duration and REM period length</p> <p><em>3)</em> There will be a significant association between eye movement patterns and dream content. </p> <p>In the SEP entry, it is written:</p> <blockquote> <p>Attempts to identify dreaming with mental activity during REM sleep have not, however, been successful, and many now hold that dreams can occur in all stages of sleep (e.g., Antrobus 1990; Foulkes 1993b; Solms 1997, 2000; Domhoff 2003; Nemeth &amp; Fazekas 2018) </p> </blockquote> <p>Notice that Aristotle, viz. On dreams; remarked that one can sometimes be aware that one is dreaming while dreaming, quote: &quot;Often when one is asleep, there's something in mind which declares that what then presents itself is but a dream.&quot;</p> <p>Eye signals can be used to measure the duration of activities or actions performed by the dreamer in lucid dreams, and results refute Dennett's <em>cassete theory</em>, which says:</p> <blockquote> <p>dreams are memory insertion at the moment of the awakenin, as if a cassette with pre-scripted dreams had been inserted into memory, ready for replay.</p> </blockquote> <p>Clearly, lucid dreams are temporally extended, and often dilated, which means actions in dream seem to take bit longer than in waking life. </p> <p>J.J. Valberg argues that there's a distinction between the sleeping person who's the dreamer of the dream and recalls the dream upon awaken|ng, and the dream self, or subject of the dream.</p> <p>What does it mean to say that a sleeping person who is <em>the dreamer of the dream</em> and who's been recalling the dream; is not the dream self or subject of the dream? If a person is the dreamer of the dream then a person is a subject of the dream. If a person recalls the dream, then a person retrieves a memory token. What does it mean to recall something beyond experience? </p> <p><em>1)</em> If the subject of the dream or the dream self isn't the sleeping person who is the dreamer of the dream and recalls it upon awaken|ng, then the dreamer who is asleep has experiences that are not his own. </p> <p><em>2)</em> You cannot have an experience that is not your own</p> <p><em>3)</em> therefore, the subject of the dream is the sleeping person who is the dreamer of the dream and recalls it upon awaken|ng. </p> <p>In any case, our limited knowledge of the dream phenomenology supports no strong claims. Nevertheless, I think we should pay close attention to empirical studies and ignore philosophical stipulations that clearly go against what we already know. </p> <p>Note: I couldn't post this for some time, because moderators think it is a good idea to track unwanted posts by keywords such as awaken|ng, hence reason why I replaced a single letter &quot;i&quot; with a symbol Pipe &quot;|&quot;. I could just leave out a letter, but doesn't matter. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Training-Promotion71"> /u/Training-Promotion71 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/1i8avgs/there_are_more_things_in_heaven_and_earth_horatio/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/1i8avgs/there_are_more_things_in_heaven_and_earth_horatio/">[comments]</a></span></p>

  <p class="info">Hacker News: Newest<br />Jan 23, 2025 01:34 PM</p>
  <p><p>Hey HN community! I'm one of the lead devs of this project at fal.ai and we created an open source lightweight video editor powered by the latest media AI models. The main goal was to tackle some challenges when dealing with complex media handling and encoding on the browser.<p>It all started as an internal experiment but as we tackled some of the issues it was clear there could be some value sharing it with the open source community.<p>Some of the key points and tech stack details:<p>- It uses IndexedDb, so all data is local (i.e. no auth, no cloud db)<p>- Multiple AI models for video, image, music and voice-over. APIs are provided by fal.ai<p>- Built with the typical React+Next.js, Shadcn front-end<p>- Used remotion.dev for the realtime video preview (this is such a great project, without it the codebase would be twice as large)<p>- File uploads so you can bring your own media by uploadthing.com<p>- ffmpeg for encoding the final video and also some ui tricks, like the audio waveform<p>We deployed a version of it and for now it's free to use. We do plan to add some rate limiting and a bring your own API Key next, but it's open source and I'm curious about what the community will build on top of it, or derive from it. Customize your own video app and if you do, please share.<p>If you have any questions, hit me up!</p>

We're an A/B testing platform that was born here as a Show HN in 2009: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=876141">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=876141</a><p>Today, I sold the company to a private equity firm for $200mn.<p>It's covered on TechCrunch: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/everstone-acquires-bootstrapped-indian-startup-wingify-for-200m/" rel="nofollow">https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/everstone-acquires-bootstr...</a><p>I was a 22 year old fresh graduate when I launched VWO on HN and got initial users. Feedback from people like @patio11 helped me get to PMF. And now, 15 years later, "site:ycombinator.com" is what I appended when I wanted to search for advice on what to keep in mind while selling my company.<p>Thank you HN for sharing inspiration and wisdom all along. I honestly don't think I would have been an entrepreneur had it not been for hacker news.<p>Every single day, HN is the first website I open! I'm feeling very grateful towards the community. Thanks @dang, and thank you Paul Graham for your essays and for creating this beautiful corner of the internet!</p>

  <p><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve recently watched the movie &quot;Whiplash&quot; for the first time. The main character of that movie seems to embody a belief that artistic greatness is worth any cost. I am really interested in what drives people in their desire for “greatness”. It seems to me that this desire is an unquestionable part of contemporary culture. In western history this concept appears to be present from the beginning: Greek heroes, Seven Sages, the story of Julius Caesar weeping while considering achievements of Alexander the Great etc. Today, people want to become great politicians, great artists, great scientists. No matter the discipline, they want to distinguish themselves from the crowd of “average” people.</p> <p>I am looking for any works about this topic. I am especially interested in the history of this &quot;desire for greatness&quot;, what might drive it, and whether similar phenomena are present in other cultures :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/luxurioussteak"> /u/luxurioussteak </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/1i85k7r/desire_to_become_great/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/1i85k7r/desire_to_become_great/">[comments]</a></span></p>

  <p class="info">Consciousness<br />Jan 23, 2025 10:11 AM</p>
  <p><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Question: Do any of you have theories on the idea of &quot;conciousness&quot; being it's own force in the universe and that it's shared between every living being? (Death isn't true death, you simply switch your mind to another conciouss being. As all animals are made of the same building blocks what makes us so unique that YOU can only exist in YOUR specific brain.)</p> <p>So I've recently been thinking about what &quot;being conciouss&quot; means and why I'm inside this brain. Things such as if another sperm made it before me, would I never have been alive/aware? While I grew in the womb by absorbing nutrients from food from other animals and I'm still here inside my own mind even though my own brain is basically made up of parts of another animal.</p> <p>This thought process gave me three ideas:</p> <ol> <li>There is a difference between a rock and a plant. A rock has no self inside it, it will never affect the universe around it of it's own violition compared to anything &quot;organic&quot; like a plant. Both of these things are made of neutrons, protons and electrons but only one of them possess life.</li> <li>Have *I* truly never existed before until this specific sperm made up of those specific molecuels made it to that specific egg? If the sperm missed would I never have been aware or alive for eternity? What made that specific sperm so unique compared to the others for it to have a whole other entity inside it?</li> <li>Every living being is &quot;alive&quot; in the exact same way with the only difference being their bodies and the level of thought they are capable of.</li> </ol> <p>When I thought about this, I got the idea that maybe conciousness is a larger background force and living enteties such as animals and plants share the same conciousness, sorta like how an antenna recieves a signal and after you die you will be born again as another living being, such as another human or even a tree.</p> <p>Maybe conciousness is just another force in the universe like gravity, space and time.</p> <p>If anyone shares any similar belief, wants to discuss any of the ideas or have their own theories I would be very happy to hear them :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/leRedditepic"> /u/leRedditepic </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/1i85i6m/discussion_about_shareduniversal_concioussness/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/1i85i6m/discussion_about_shareduniversal_concioussness/">[comments]</a></span></p>

  <p class="info">Consciousness<br />Jan 23, 2025 09:10 AM</p>
  <p><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Question: Does the Recursive Network Model Account for the Attributes of Consciousness?</p> <p>Answer: Yes, the model accounts for subjectivity, privacy, unity, change, intentionality, self-awareness, continuity, and questioning. This builds on two prior posts.</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/1i534bb/the_physical_basis_of_consciousness/">https://www.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/1i534bb/the_physical_basis_of_consciousness/</a></p> <p> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/1i6lej3/recursive_networks_provide_answers_to/">https://www.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/1i6lej3/recursive_networks_provide_answers_to/</a></p> <p>Subjectivity: An experience is unique to each person because it is composed of a recursive network binding their own personal perceptions and their own personal collection of memories and learned responses, accumulated over a lifetime of learning and stored in the patterns of synapses in their brain. Those patterns are unique to the individual. </p> <p>Privacy: Consciousness cannot be shared because it is too unique to each person. The largest part of an experience is based on input from subconscious memories, which are not in the recursive subset. The non-recursive portion of recognition does not leave a short term memory path and cannot be observed or reported. As often happens, two people may have entirely different responses to a situation, and yet be unable to account for the discrepancy, because the majority of their decision making inputs were subconscious. </p> <p>Unity: Consciousness combines multiple sensory inputs into a single experience by including concepts housed in mini-columns from many areas of the brain in the recursive network. Even those sensory inputs that are not included in the recursive network still influence the cascade prior to recursion. </p> <p>Change: A thought is a recursive network binding a set of concepts into a single entity. Thinking occurs when the network iterates, adding new concepts and dropping others, changing over time. As we observe our conscious thoughts, we see them drift from one subject to another. </p> <p>Intentionality: A thought has one or more subjects among the many concepts included in the recursive network. A subject can be said to have the mind’s attention if that recursive network dominates the neocortex, even though the brain is also engaged in many other activities at the same time. Thoughts of the subject include thousands of concepts related to the subject, included its functions and purpose. </p> <p>Self-awareness: Consciousness of the self occurs when self-reflective concepts are included in the recursive networks of day to day life. A person with knowledge of self-reflective memes is able to combine them with the set of PRN comprising personal identity, thus enabling awareness of self. A person may simply think about a flower, or may think about a flower and what it means to or for the person. The former is a recursive network without self-reflective concepts and the latter is a recursive network that includes self-reflective concepts.</p> <p>Continuity: Humans keep a running stream of active memory. It is the combination of recent events in short term memory, current thoughts, and expectations of the immediate future. It is an iterative stream of recursive networks that changes with every step we take. As we go through the day, we leave behind a trail of short-term memory and also chemicals that will modify our synapses in sleep and archive some of our day in long-term memory. </p> <p>In the process, details are lost. I can reconstruct what I was thinking two minutes ago, but probably not two hours ago, and certainly not two days ago. I can, however, recall where I was two days ago, and who I was with. Probably not two years ago though. I certainly recall where I lived two years ago, and what my house looked like. But how about twenty-two years ago. “Hmmm. Was I still living in the house on Mobile Street then, or had I moved to St. Georges Avenue? Was I even married then? Let me think. What year was my first divorce?” Our memory fades with time.</p> <p>What does not fade is the sense of continuity. I have a personal history, an identity, a collection of memories that defines me. I know where I was and what I was doing with some degree of detail throughout all the years of my life. I feel strongly that when I awoke this morning, I was the same person who fell asleep in my bed last night. To paraphrase Descartes, I remember, therefore, I am. My memories of myself from early childhood through yesterday evening are stored in the patterns of synaptic connections between the 86,000,000,000 neurons in my brain. </p> <p>When I summon up thoughts of myself, my identity, I am generating recursive feedback loops among mini-columns representing the details of all those memories, and I know who I am. When I say that I am self-aware, this is the self that I am aware of. It is that collection of memories, housed in my mini-columns that is unique to me, the concept I call “me,” the person who fell asleep in my bed last night, and it is a manifestation of the synaptic connections in my brain. </p> <p>Questioning: There are mini-columns for negative concepts such as wrong, missing, incomplete, question, challenge, skeptical. These are learned memes based on thousands of years of philosophy. Most people today are able to ask questions because they are taught in childhood to include these memes in their iterative networks. They have been taught to recognize when a recursion subset is incomplete or incorrect. They are taught and encouraged to innovate. </p> <p>Note that this is cultural, and that some cultures discourage questioning and innovation. Recall that Skepticism and the questioning of knowledge was a radical idea at the time of Socrates. Even today, children in some fundamentalist religious cultures are taught that questioning and innovation are evil and sinful.</p> <p>The human ability to question warrants its own book. One could argue that humans have not yet mastered the skills of questioning and challenging information. If they had, then they would recognize and reject propaganda. Consider the implications this would have on politics, war, religion, news media, and social media. Most people do not exercise enough skepticism. Humans can question, but, sadly, they often do not. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/MergingConcepts"> /u/MergingConcepts </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/1i847bd/recursive_network_model_accounts_for_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/1i847bd/recursive_network_model_accounts_for_the/">[comments]</a></span></p>

  <p><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What critical theory would you recommend for a poet? I’ve read a bit of Marx and Freud, Mark Fisher, Walter Benjamin, some CCRU stuff. When I was younger at university I had some prejudices against theory and preferred close reading / practical criticism. I feel like I lack a framework for why I do the things I do, and I’m sure I have lots of blind spots. I’m especially interested in theory that can be joyful to read, and embodied, also interested in theory-fiction, or theory that can be read as fiction. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Possible_Couple291"> /u/Possible_Couple291 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/1i81sf5/theory_for_poets/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/1i81sf5/theory_for_poets/">[comments]</a></span></p>

  <p><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Does a claim &quot;consciousness does not exist&quot; have any reasonable basis? Answer. I don't understand the format. I am asking you the question.</p> <p>I have just watched a video of Rupert Sheldrake's speech about the 10 scientific dogmas. While I think almost all of those dogmas are false I also think the materialistic mechanistic scientists might be right about consciousness not existing. I believe awareness and aliveness exist. But not consciousness because usually what I see people including myself talk about is that we are conscious and we get emotional and mystical talking about consciousness because we are egoistically personally involved. But in the end I am starting to conclude that it's just the work of delusional ego being confused and pretending to hold some deep understanding of the universe.</p> <p>Consciousness seems like a mix of aliveness and awareness which is impossible. We cannot be passive, observant and aware while being active, creative and alive. There is no combination of those two. We just make it up. Maybe we want a mystery. Maybe we like the idea of unifying spirituality into something. I don't know why, maybe everybody has their own reason to make stuff up. Can you argue against that? I guess I would rather be wrong about this. It would be cool to have some consciousness.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Pristine-Sir-8344"> /u/Pristine-Sir-8344 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/1i7y66g/does_a_claim_consciousness_does_not_exist_have/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/consciousness/comments/1i7y66g/does_a_claim_consciousness_does_not_exist_have/">[comments]</a></span></p>

  <p class="info">Hacker News: Newest<br />Jan 23, 2025 12:07 AM</p>
  <p><p>A year ago I surveyed the internet and noticed there was only one popular space for trans and gender-non-conforming people to meet; Lex.<p>Lex is not well liked by its users. Its software feels heavy and it is full of cash grabs and anti-patterns. It was recently acquired and is sure to only become more hostile to its users as it turns towards profit generation.<p>With this in mind I built t4t, an alternative specially designed for not only queer people, but specifically trans people.<p>It is an extremely lightweight service. I built it with my most ideal stack: Flutter, Svelte, Supabase, Posthog.<p>It has grown in the last year to about 4,000 monthly active users. I think it could grow way beyond that this year.</p>
