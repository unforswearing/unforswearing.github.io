# Intranet Proposal

To establish reasonable timelines for the completion of
specific intranet related features, I propose we narrow the scope of our
work to four key areas:

*HR Documents/The New Hire On-Boarding process*

Work with the HR department to establish electronic forms of the various
HR documents that currently exist in PDF format on SharePoint. These
include the PAN form, New Hire packets, Health insurance forms, etc.
Estimated timeline for completion. Determine how to incorporate the new
hire paperwork as part of an intranet business process, how to generate an
employee file/profile from the new hire packet information, how to use
the electronic signature with federal documents, etc. Estimated timeline
for completion - 1/15/2015

*Business Processes*

What benchmarks and deadlines do we need to have for learning business
processes?

- needs
- solutions available

*Task Prioritization with our Consultant*

- What do we want the consultant to do for us?  
- How long will the work take?   
- How do we determine priority for each item?

*Communication Department Needs/Layout*

Speak with Christine about estimated benchmarks and deadlines for
getting the Comm team fully set up in intranet.

*Permissions Schema*

Flesh out a basic permissions schema that can be used for departments in
the stores. This may not be entirely portable to each store, but having
a basic structure to copy and paste as a part of the intranet setup will
prevent stores from having to set their permissions from scratch. This
will also allow departmental support staff to prepare documents and
information according to its intended audience. Estimated timeline for
completion - 1/31/2015

*External Integration*

Work with the ADP API to determine compatibility, export/import of
employee information, our ability to push data from intranet to ADP (we
are scheduled to migrate to ADP version 7 on 1/21/2015). Work with
Active Directory to determine compatibility with intranet, and how that
will function for employees in different positions/with different
permissions. Determine what functionality we need from Google Drive and
how to seamlessly integrate Google Drive document editing, forms, and
spreadsheet data within the intranet. Estimated timeline for completion -
2/16/2015

Anything that falls outside the scope of these main areas can be added to a list of desired features to be incorporated at a later date.
