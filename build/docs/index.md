# About

Hello, my name is Alvin.

I am a thoughtful, detail-oriented copywriter and technical writer excited to share my extensive knowledge with new collaborators. I have over twenty years of experience writing well-researched, in-voice copy for social media, newsletters, print promotional materials, technical documentation, end-user training guides, web pages, product copy, and mobile apps. My additional professional experience includes project management, web programming, business automation, audio engineering, photo editing, and video production.

I am open to new work. If my experience is what you're looking for, lets chat on LinkedIn: [LinkedIn.com/in/Alvin-Charity](https://linkedin.com/in/alvin-charity)
